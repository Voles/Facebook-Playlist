# Facebook Playlist

This project is the result of an experiment I've set up to test my Backbone-skills.

# How it works
After you've logged in to Facebook, the application fetches the latest YouTube-video's from your stream and creates a playlist.

It's very easy to jump to next- & previous songs or play / pause the current song.

# Demo
You can play around with the application on http://backbone.nielsdequeker.be/
